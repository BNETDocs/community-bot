# BNETDocs Community Bot (BCB)
A WIP community-built bot written in Python (3.6) for the classic Battle.net v1 chat platform.

## API Keys
The classic Battle.net chat API requires a key to use. You can obtain one by logging in to one of the classic games (StarCraft, Diablo 2, or WarCraft 3) and going to your preferred clan or op channel and using the /register-bot command. You will need to have an email registered to your account and click the activation link in the email.

Running the command again will send you a new key and invalidate the old one.
